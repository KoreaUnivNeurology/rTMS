# rTMS Analysis in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy

This repository contains code for analyzing EEG-based functional connectivity changes and machine learning modeling from the study:  
**‚ÄúNetwork-based effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation in drug-resistant epilepsy: a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial‚Äù**

## üöÄ **Main Objectives**
- Analyze pre- and post-rTMS EEG data to assess changes in brain functional connectivity using weighted phase lag index (**wPLI**) across multiple frequency bands.
- Perform correlation analysis between EEG connectivity changes and clinical outcomes (e.g., seizure frequency).
- Develop machine learning models (Logistic Regression) to classify rTMS responders and predict optimal stimulation dose.

## üîç **Key Features**
- **Seizure Frequency Comparison**: Visual comparison of seizure frequency pre- and post-stimulation.
- **EEG Connectivity Visualization**: Display inter-electrode and ROI-based wPLI difference matrices.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore statistical relationships between connectivity changes and clinical outcomes.
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic regression models for responder classification and dose prediction, with ROC curve evaluation.

## üìÇ **Repository Contents**
- **`rTMS_Analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis pipeline: data preprocessing, connectivity analysis, correlation analysis, machine learning modeling, and visualization.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- The current code **does not include raw EEG data**, which is required to reproduce the analysis.
